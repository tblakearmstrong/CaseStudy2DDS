# About the Project
## Objective 1
The primary objective is to develop a robust predictive model that accurately forecasts wine quality based on various features. We aim to achieve the lowest possible Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test set, ensuring high precision in our predictions.

## Objective 2
Beyond prediction, this project aims to delve into the dataset to identify the key determinants of high-quality wine. By analyzing the relationships between various chemical properties and wine quality, we can provide valuable insights to vintners, potentially leading to improvements in wine production.
